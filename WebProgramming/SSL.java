    /*SSL and Secure Web Communications
    The previous examples sent a field called Password to the server. However, standard
    HTTP doesn’t provide encryption to hide our data. Fortunately, adding security for
    GET and POST operations like this is easy (trivial, in fact, for the client-side developer).
    Where available, you simply need to use a secure form of the HTTP protocol—
    HTTPS:
    https://www.myserver.example/cgi-bin/login.cgi
    HTTPS is a version of the standard HTTP protocol run over Secure Sockets Layer
    (SSL), which uses public-key encryption techniques to encrypt the browser-to-server
    communications. Most web browsers and servers currently come with built-in sup‐
    port for HTTPS (or raw SSL sockets). Therefore, if your web server supports HTTPS
    and has it configured, you can use a browser to send and receive secure data simply
    by specifying the https protocol in your URLs. There is much more to learn about
    SSL and related aspects of security, such as authenticating whom you are actually talk‐
    ing to, but as far as basic data encryption goes, this is all you have to do. It is not
    something your code has to deal with directly. The Java JRE standard edition ships
    with SSL and HTTPS support, and beginning with Java 5.0, all Java implementations
    must support HTTPS as well as HTTP for URL connections

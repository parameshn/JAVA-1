 * This code snippet demonstrates a common approach to generating a hash code
 * for strings in Java:
 * 
 * java
 * Copy code
 * int hash = 0;
 * for (char ch : str.toCharArray()) {
 * hash = hash * 31 + ch;
 * }
 * Explanation
 * Hash Code Calculation:
 * 
 * The loop iterates over each character in the string, str.
 * For each character, it updates the hash variable by multiplying the current
 * hash value by 31 (a prime number) and then adding the character‚Äôs ASCII (or
 * Unicode) value.
 * This process accumulates a unique numerical representation for the string
 * based on the characters' order and values.
 * Why 31 is Used:
 * 
 * Multiplying by 31 (a prime number) helps distribute hash values more
 * uniformly across a range of values, reducing the likelihood of hash
 * collisions.
 * A power of 2 (like 32) would cause patterns in the hash value, especially at
 * the low end of the bits. This happens because multiplying by 2 repeatedly
 * shifts binary information to the left, which can reduce the "randomness" of
 * the lower bits.
 * Using 31 (a prime) maintains useful information in the lower bits, which are
 * often used in hash table indexing (since the Collections Framework uses bit
 * masking rather than division for efficiency).
 * Indexing in Hash Tables:
 * 
 * Hash tables use the hash code to determine where to place an entry in the
 * table.
 * Java‚Äôs HashMap, for instance, doesn‚Äôt use a simple remainder operation with
 * the table size to find an index. Instead, it uses bit masking, which is
 * faster. This masking process emphasizes the lower bits of the hash code.
 * Since the lower bits directly affect the table position, using a prime
 * multiplier helps spread hash codes more evenly, preventing clusters of data
 * in particular areas of the table.
 * Why Prime Multiplication Helps:
 * 
 * Multiplying by a prime number avoids patterns in the resulting hash code,
 * keeping more of the initial information intact throughout the hash
 * computation.
 * This results in better distribution when the hash code is reduced to an index
 * by bit masking, which helps to avoid "clumping" of entries, improving hash
 * table performance.
 * This method, using a multiplier of 31, is widely used for string hashing, as
 * it provides a good balance of efficiency and distribution quality.

 * Yes, exactly. When you multiply by a power of 2 (like 32), you‚Äôre effectively
 * performing a bitwise left shift in binary representation. This left shift has
 * a significant effect:
 * 
 * Left Shift Reduces Variability in Low Bits:
 * 
 * In binary, multiplying by powers of 2 shifts bits to the left, filling in
 * zeros from the right. For instance, multiplying by 2 shifts all bits one
 * place to the left, multiplying by 4 shifts all bits two places to the left,
 * and so on.
 * This shift causes a pattern in which the lower bits (the least significant
 * bits) may end up becoming zero more often or repeating predictable values,
 * especially with repeated multiplications.
 * As a result, critical information can be "pushed out" of the lower bits over
 * multiple iterations, reducing the randomness or variability in those bits.
 * This is problematic because hash tables often use those lower bits for
 * determining bucket placement.
 * Why This is a Problem for Hashing:
 * 
 * Hash tables typically use only a portion of the hash code, often just the
 * lower bits, to determine an index.
 * If there‚Äôs a pattern or lack of variability in these lower bits, it could
 * lead to clustering ‚Äî where multiple hash values end up in the same table
 * slot, causing collisions and reducing the efficiency of the hash table.
 * Using a Prime Like 31 Avoids This:
 * 
 * When you multiply by a non-power-of-2 prime (like 31), you don‚Äôt get the
 * left-shifting effect.
 * Instead, each multiplication by 31 mixes the bits more uniformly, ensuring
 * that no specific bit position (including the lower bits) gets consistently
 * shifted out or set to zero.
 * This process retains a higher degree of randomness and uniqueness across the
 * entire hash code, especially in the lower bits, which helps in evenly
 * distributing entries in the hash table.
 * In summary, multiplying by a prime like 31 helps maintain information across
 * all bits in the hash code, including the lower bits, avoiding the predictable
 * patterns that would arise from using powers of 2. This better distribution in
 * the hash values leads to a more efficient hash table with fewer collisions.

 * You said:
 * bit masking?
 * ChatGPT said:
 * ChatGPT
 * Bit masking is a technique that uses bitwise operations (like AND, OR, XOR,
 * and NOT) with a "mask" value to manipulate specific bits within a binary
 * number. It‚Äôs especially useful for efficiently extracting or setting specific
 * parts of a number, such as checking if particular bits are on or off.
 * 
 * In the context of hash tables, bit masking is often used to quickly calculate
 * an index within a table's length, particularly when the length is a power of
 * 2. Here's how it works:
 * 
 * Example of Bit Masking in Hash Tables
 * Typical Index Calculation: Traditionally, to map a hash code to an index in a
 * hash table of length
 * ùëÅ
 * N, you could use modulo operation:
 * 
 * index
 * =
 * hashCode
 * 
 * %
 * 
 * ùëÅ
 * index=hashCode%N
 * But modulo operations can be computationally expensive. When
 * ùëÅ
 * N is a power of 2, this can be simplified using bit masking.
 * 
 * Using Bit Masking:
 * 
 * If
 * ùëÅ
 * N is a power of 2 (say
 * ùëÅ
 * =
 * 16
 * N=16), we can use a bitwise AND operation with
 * ùëÅ
 * ‚àí
 * 1
 * N‚àí1 (which is
 * 15
 * 15 in binary: 1111).
 * This effectively isolates the lower bits of the hash code, which gives the
 * remainder without needing the modulo operation.
 * For example:
 * 
 * java
 * Copy code
 * int tableLength = 16; // Must be a power of 2
 * int index = hashCode & (tableLength - 1);
 * Here, tableLength - 1 creates a mask of 1111 (for 16 - 1), so only the lowest
 * 4 bits of hashCode are used.
 * This is much faster than a division-based modulo, and when the hash table
 * size is carefully chosen (as a power of 2), this efficiently distributes
 * items across table slots.
 * Practical Use in Java Hash Tables
 * In Java's HashMap, for example, bit masking is used to compute the index for
 * a bucket in an array by taking advantage of this power-of-2 length
 * optimization. It‚Äôs a core part of how hash tables achieve both speed and
 * distribution of entries, helping prevent clustering by efficiently scattering
 * hash codes over the array's length.
 * 
 * Summary of Bit Masking
 * Bit masking is a fast, low-level operation that can replace more
 * computationally intensive calculations, like modulo, especially in hash
 * tables where quick, uniform distribution of elements is critical

// still works the same?

/*
 * Thread Safety:
 * 
 * With SwingUtilities.invokeLater(): The label is updated on the EDT, ensuring
 * that the GUI component changes are thread-safe. This adheres to Swingâ€™s
 * single-threaded rule, preventing potential race conditions and inconsistent
 * UI states.
 * Without SwingUtilities.invokeLater(): The label is updated directly from the
 * worker thread. This violates Swing's threading model, as Swing components
 * should only be accessed and modified on the EDT. While it might work in
 * simple cases, it introduces the risk of threading issues and undefined
 * behavior, especially as the application scales or becomes more complex.
 * UI Responsiveness and Stability:
 * 
 * With SwingUtilities.invokeLater(): The method allows for the GUI to remain
 * responsive. By scheduling the update to the label on the EDT, it ensures that
 * the UI can process other events concurrently and updates are executed
 * smoothly.
 * Without SwingUtilities.invokeLater(): Updating the label directly on the
 * worker thread can cause the UI to become unresponsive if other threads are
 * also interacting with the GUI. It can lead to a poor user experience,
 * especially if the updates are frequent or if there are multiple threads
 * involved.
 * Code Maintenance and Scalability:
 * 
 * With SwingUtilities.invokeLater(): This approach scales well as it adheres to
 * best practices for Swing programming. It ensures that all UI updates are
 * managed in a single, predictable thread, making it easier to debug and extend
 * the application.
 * Without SwingUtilities.invokeLater(): As the application grows, directly
 * updating the UI from multiple threads can become difficult to manage and
 * debug. It can lead to complex threading issues that are hard to diagnose and
 * fix.
 * 
 * Why SwingUtilities.invokeLater() is Preferred:
 * Swing is Not Thread-Safe: Swing components should be manipulated only on the
 * EDT to avoid inconsistencies and potential crashes.
 * Predictable Behavior: Using SwingUtilities.invokeLater() ensures that the UI
 * updates are handled in a consistent and predictable manner.
 * Best Practices: It aligns with the recommended practices for Swing
 * development, making the code robust and maintainable.

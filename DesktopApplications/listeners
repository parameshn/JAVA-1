  If you’re unsure what events a particular component supports, check its documenta
tion for methods that look like addXYZListener(). That “XYZ” type will hand you a
 direct clue about where else to look in the documentation. Once you have the docu
mentation for the listener, try implementing every method and simply printing which
event was reported. It’s a little trial and error, but you can learn a lot about how the
 various Swing components react to keyboard and mouse events this way.

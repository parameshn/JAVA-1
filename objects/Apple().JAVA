Apple a1 = new Apple();

/*In Java, when you create an object of a class, you use the `new` keyword followed by the class constructor. The parentheses `()` are used to invoke the constructor of the class. The constructor is a special method in a class that is responsible for initializing the object. While it might resemble a function call, it is specifically used for creating and initializing objects.

Here's a breakdown of the statement `Apple a1 = new Apple();`:

- `new Apple()`: This part creates a new instance of the `Apple` class by calling its constructor. The parentheses are necessary to indicate that the constructor should be invoked.

- `Apple a1 = ...`: This part declares a variable named `a1` of type `Apple` and assigns the newly created `Apple` object to it.

Constructors are similar to functions in the sense that they perform a set of actions, but they are specifically designed for object initialization. The use of parentheses when creating an object is a common syntax in many object-oriented programming languages, not just Java.*/


//In the given code snippet:


class Apple {
 float mass;
 float diameter = 1.0f;
 int x, y;
 boolean isTouching(Apple other) {
   // ...
 }
 // ...
}
/*There is no explicit constructor defined in the `Apple` class. In Java, if you do not provide a constructor in your class, a default constructor is automatically generated by the compiler. The default constructor has no parameters and initializes any member variables to their default values. */

//If you want to provide your own constructor for the `Apple` class, you can define one explicitly. For example:


class Apple {
 float mass;
 float diameter = 1.0f;
 int x, y;

 // Explicit constructor
 Apple() {
   // Initialization or additional setup code can be placed here
 }

 boolean isTouching(Apple other) {
   // ...
 }
 // ...
}


/*In the code above, `Apple()` is a no-argument constructor for the `Apple` class. If you instantiate an `Apple` object using `new Apple()`, this constructor will be invoked, and you can include any initialization code or other logic within it. If you don't explicitly provide a constructor, the default constructor is used implicitly. */
